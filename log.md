## Project: prefix-jump (Zed Editor Extension)

### 1. Project Setup

- Renamed project directory from 'zed-slash-command' to 'prefix-jump'
  ```bash
  mv /Users/matthew/projects/zed-slash-command /Users/matthew/projects/prefix-jump
  ```
- Generated a new Ed25519 SSH key for Git authentication
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "git-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
  ```
- Initialized Git repository with initial commit
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```
- Set up GitHub remote repository at `git@github.com:cephalonaut/prefix-jump.git`
- Pushed initial code to GitHub
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### 2. Rust Environment Updates

- Updated Rust toolchain from stable 1.54.0 to stable 1.85.1
  ```bash
  rustup update stable
  ```
- Temporarily used nightly channel to address `edition2021` feature requirements
  ```bash
  rustup override set nightly
  ```
- Removed unnecessary `cargo-features = ["edition2021"]` from Cargo.toml after updating
- Switched back to stable Rust
  ```bash
  rustup default stable
  rustup override unset
  ```
- Added `wasm32-wasip1` target for WebAssembly compilation
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
  ```

### 3. Extension Development

- Created skeleton code for Zed editor slash command extension
  - Implemented `PrefixJumpExtension` for activation/deactivation
  - Added `PrefixJumpCommand` for slash command functionality
  - Created `CommandParams` for parsing command arguments
- Set up Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies:
  - zed_extension_api
  - async-trait
  - serde/serde_json
  - anyhow
  - log
- Successfully built the project
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

### 4. Extension Packaging

- Successfully built WASM binary
  ```bash
  cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
  ```
- Created extension.json with metadata (name, version, description)
- Generated extension package structure
  ```bash
  mkdir -p extension/prefix-jump
  cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/prefix-jump.wasm extension/prefix-jump/
  cp extension.json extension/prefix-jump/
  ```

### 5. Project Structure Fixes

- Fixed project directory structure by removing double-nested src directory
  ```bash
  mv src/src/main.rs src/main.rs
  rm -r src/src
  ```
- Resulted in proper Rust project structure:
  ```
  prefix-jump/
  ├── src/
  │   └── main.rs
  ├── Cargo.toml
  └── extension.json
  ```

### 6. Conclusions

We have successfully set up the infrastructure for a Zed editor extension called "prefix-jump". The project includes a basic extension structure with a slash command implementation, properly configured dependencies, and the necessary packaging setup for installing in Zed. At this stage, we have focused primarily on the foundational setup rather than the full implementation of the prefix-jump functionality. The extension is built and packaged as WebAssembly, and is ready for local installation and testing in the Zed editor. Further work will be needed to implement the core prefix-jump functionality using Zed's extension API capabilities.
